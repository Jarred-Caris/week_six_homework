Weather App

## Week six home work project

For this weeks project, we were tasked with creating a weather search application that would utilize api calls to show thge weather for a given city. this would also show future forecasts and save previous searches to local storage.

## This is the end result

## Where to access code

Week_six_homework git hub page.

## My contribution

For this project, we were instructed to create the weather app from scratch. No starting code was given.

I started the project strong and was happy with my progress but leading up to the due date, a major issue came up.

I had completed a very large amount of code in my javascript and my laptop decided to completely fail. This happened before i was able to push my code to my git hub page and had lost hours of research and work put in previously. After spending 2 days trying to recover my data as it was saved to my hardrive, i had to go out and purchase a new laptop. Reinstall all the programs and set it up for the class room again and had to start most of my coding from scratch. 

I started coding again but at this time, we had our group project going so it was hard to juggle the assigments. I have gotten most of the core elements to work but reluctantly, am submitting the page with some glaring issues. 


**explaining my page**

I am happy with the overall presentation of the page. it is simple and user friendly. The api calls for the current city search work great and i learnt alot about the importance of apis in this field of work.

My issues im aware of and will be noticed when reviewing my work is that the cities saved to local storage works fine, but will generate the whole array repeated as buttons. This fixes itself on page refresh but its annoying issue i could not seem to work around. the buttons also dont seem to bring up the previous searches. The forecast also works for the most part but sometimes only shows the one day forecast. Im unsure as to why it faults at times. 

This is not the product i wanted to put forward. I have been happy with my work leading up to this point and in most cases, have been able to submit a completed project. Regardless on my grade, i will be revisiting this page as i think this project was an amazing experience. i learnt a great deal. As im still not very confident with my javascript, i do feel my understanding grow and would like this page to be more polished and functional.
